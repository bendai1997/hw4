In this frog-eating fly program. 
The frog is sitting still in the center of the frame. 
There is a fly constantly flying on top of him. 
The fly is always making the Weng Weng voice. 
The fly flies in a relatively straight direction, but it will vibrate top and down. 
The user moves the mouse to aim the fly, while the mouse is moving, the frog’s eyeball will follow the location of the mouse. 
Then, the user clicks the mouse and the frog’s mouse will extend rapidly and try to catch the fly. 
There will also be a tongue slurping sound. 
If the frog catches the fly, then the tongue will contract and then follows with a burping sound. 
If the frog didn't catch the fly, then the tongue will also contract and burp.
